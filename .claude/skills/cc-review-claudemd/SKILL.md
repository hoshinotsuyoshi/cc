# Review CLAUDE.md from Conversation History

Analyze recent conversations to improve both global (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) and local (project) CLAUDE.md files.

Based on: https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/tree/main/skills/review-claudemd

## Step 1: Find Conversation History

The project's conversation history is in `~/.claude/projects/`. The folder name is the project path with slashes replaced by dashes.

```bash
# Find the project folder (replace / with -)
PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd | sed 's|/|-|g' | sed 's|^-||')
CONVO_DIR=~/.claude/projects/-${PROJECT_PATH}
ls -lt "$CONVO_DIR"/*.jsonl | head -20
```

## Step 2: Extract Recent Conversations

Extract the 15-20 most recent conversations (excluding the current one) to a temp directory:

```bash
SCRATCH=/tmp/claudemd-review-$(date +%s)
mkdir -p "$SCRATCH"

for f in $(ls -t "$CONVO_DIR"/*.jsonl | head -20); do
  basename=$(basename "$f" .jsonl)
  cat "$f" | jq -r '
    if .type == "user" then
      "USER: " + (.message.content // "")
    elif .type == "assistant" then
      "ASSISTANT: " + ((.message.content // []) | map(select(.type == "text") | .text) | join("\n"))
    else
      empty
    end
  ' 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^ASSISTANT: $" > "$SCRATCH/${basename}.txt"
done

ls -lhS "$SCRATCH"
```

## Step 3: Analyze with Subagents

Launch parallel Sonnet subagents to analyze conversations. Each agent should read:
- Global CLAUDE.md: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Local CLAUDE.md: `./CLAUDE.md` (if exists)
- Batch of conversation files

Give each agent this prompt:

```
Read:
1. Global CLAUDE.md: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
2. Local CLAUDE.md: [project]/CLAUDE.md
3. Conversations: [list of files]

Analyze the conversations against BOTH CLAUDE.md files. Find:
1. Instructions that exist but were violated (need reinforcement or rewording)
2. Patterns that should be added to LOCAL CLAUDE.md (project-specific)
3. Patterns that should be added to GLOBAL CLAUDE.md (applies everywhere)
4. Anything in either file that seems outdated or unnecessary

Be specific. Output bullet points only.
```

Batch conversations by size:
- Large (>100KB): 1-2 per agent
- Medium (10-100KB): 3-5 per agent
- Small (<10KB): 5-10 per agent

## Step 4: Aggregate Findings

Combine results from all agents into a summary with these sections:

## Output Format

```
## Analysis Summary

### Instructions Violated
- Existing rules that weren't followed (need stronger wording)

### Suggested Additions - LOCAL
- Project-specific patterns to add

### Suggested Additions - GLOBAL
- Patterns that apply everywhere

### Potentially Outdated
- Items that may no longer be relevant

## Proposed Edits
- [ ] Edit 1
- [ ] Edit 2
```

Ask user if they want edits drafted.
